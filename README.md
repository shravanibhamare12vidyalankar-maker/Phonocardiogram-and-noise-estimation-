Phonocardiogram (PCG) and noise estimation focuses on analyzing heart sound signals to identify and quantify unwanted noise components. The project processes recorded heart sounds to separate useful cardiac information from noise, improving signal clarity for better detection of heartbeats and abnormalities.
